//! MQTT Module trait and utilities.
//!
//! This module defines the object-safe `MqttModule` trait that allows building
//! reusable MQTT integrations (e.g. Home Assistant, telemetry, OTA updates).
//!
//! # Object Safety
//!
//! The `MqttModule` trait is designed to be dyn-compatible, meaning you can use
//! `&mut dyn MqttModule<MAX_TOPICS>` as a trait object. This is essential for
//! `no_std` embedded environments where you want to:
//!
//! - Store modules in `StaticCell` and pass them to Embassy tasks
//! - Avoid generic type parameters on task functions
//! - Decouple runtime infrastructure from module-specific logic
//!
//! # Publishing Pattern
//!
//! Modules never perform async I/O directly. Instead, they use the `PublishOutbox`
//! trait to queue publish requests. The runtime then performs the actual async
//! publishing after the module method returns.
//!
//! This separation keeps the trait object-safe while maintaining good performance.

/// Object-safe trait for queuing MQTT publish requests.
///
/// Modules use this to schedule publishes during `on_tick` and `on_start`.
/// The actual async publishing is done by the runtime after the module returns.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn on_tick(&mut self, outbox: &mut dyn PublishOutbox) -> Duration {
///     outbox.publish("device/state", b"online", QoS::AtMostOnce);
///     Duration::from_secs(30)
/// }
/// ```
pub trait PublishOutbox {
    /// Queue a message for publishing.
    ///
    /// This is synchronous and returns immediately. The runtime will
    /// actually publish the message asynchronously after the module
    /// method returns.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// - `topic`: The MQTT topic to publish to
    /// - `payload`: The message payload bytes
    /// - `qos`: Quality of Service level
    fn publish(&mut self, topic: &str, payload: &[u8], qos: QoS);
}

/// Object-safe trait for MQTT modules that handle incoming messages and periodic tasks.
///
/// Implement this trait to create reusable MQTT integrations (e.g. Home Assistant,
/// telemetry, OTA updates). Modules are composed together and driven by the
/// `MqttRuntime`.
///
/// # Object Safety
///
/// This trait is designed to be dyn-compatible (`dyn MqttModule<MAX_TOPICS>`),
/// allowing modules to be stored as trait objects in `no_std` environments
/// without heap allocation.
///
/// Key design choices for object safety:
/// - No `async fn` methods (all I/O is done via `PublishOutbox`)
/// - No generic type parameters on methods
/// - Transport-agnostic (modules don't know about TCP, UART, etc.)
///
/// # Topic Registration
///
/// Topics must be `'static` strings. This is typical for embedded use cases
/// where topics are compile-time constants. If you need dynamic topics,
/// store them in `heapless::String` fields that live as long as the module.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// const CMD_TOPIC: &str = "device/cmd";
/// const STATE_TOPIC: &str = "device/state";
///
/// struct MyModule {
///     pending_state_update: bool,
/// }
///
/// impl<const MAX_TOPICS: usize> MqttModule<MAX_TOPICS> for MyModule {
///     fn register(&self, registry: &mut TopicRegistry<'_, MAX_TOPICS>) {
///         let _ = registry.add(CMD_TOPIC);
///     }
///
///     fn on_message(&mut self, msg: &Publish<'_>) {
///         if msg.topic == CMD_TOPIC {
///             // Process command, set flag for response
///             self.pending_state_update = true;
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn on_tick(&mut self, outbox: &mut dyn PublishOutbox) -> Duration {
///         outbox.publish(STATE_TOPIC, b"online", QoS::AtMostOnce);
///         Duration::from_secs(30)
///     }
///
///     fn needs_immediate_publish(&self) -> bool {
///         self.pending_state_update
///     }
